## randomness

this program speaks and it have a random game and it also givs you a random word

### so here is how it works: 

when you run it speaks and then it will tell you to input sumthing so when you input sumthing

it tells you do want to speak it or save it or do you want to play a game or get a random word so if you choose the random word

it will tell you a single word or a list of word or the word of the day so if you choose the word of the day it tell you a random word

### and it will repeat the whole process again
